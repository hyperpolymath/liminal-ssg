**Time-reversible site generation in Janus.**
"January" — The two-faced god. Every build is a reversible transformation where the output can be inverted back to its exact source.

== Why january-ssg?
=== Deterministic Invertibility
Janus ensures every statement has a unique inverse. You can "uncall" a procedure to revert a site build to its previous state with mathematical certainty.

=== Thermodynamic Efficiency
Reversible computing circumvents the Landauer limit of energy dissipation. `january-ssg` is the most energy-efficient engine for **Edge tech** deployments.
